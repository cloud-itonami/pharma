(ns pharma.app
  "Pharma appview frontend shell.

  Migrated from the Svelte/Vite scaffold at
  appview/etzhayyim-wasm-pharma-f0963b54/svelte (a single `App.svelte` with a
  heading + one paragraph, no interactivity, no routing) to reagent + re-frame,
  rendered with `jp-go-dds.core` (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup. This is
  still a scaffold, not the OTC pharmacy platform described in the sibling
  CLAUDE.md / kotodama.jsonld's `convoSystemPrompt` — see
  docs/operator-quickstart.md for what is and is not implemented here.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced once, at authoring time,
  by `jp-go-dds.page/->page` running on the JVM (via this deps.edn's jp-go-dds
  git/sha), concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css`
  — exactly what `jp-go-dds.page/page` composes for its own <style> block.
  This namespace itself only requires `jp-go-dds.core` — the browser bundle
  does not need `jp-go-dds.page` or `html.core` at runtime; those are JVM-only
  tools used to author the static shell once. Regenerate that shell (e.g. if
  jp-go-dds's core components or ext-rules change) with:

    (require '[jp-go-dds.page :as page] '[clojure.java.io :as io])
    (spit \"public/index.html\"
          (page/->page {:title \"etzhayyim-wasm-pharma-f0963b54\"
                         :description \"Pharma appview frontend shell (reagent + re-frame + jp-go-dds).\"
                         :css (slurp (io/resource \"jp_go_dds/dds.css\"))}
                        [:div {:id \"app\"}]
                        [:script {:src \"js/app.js\"}]))"
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [jp-go-dds.core :as dds]))
